# SoundDeal
SoundDeal is a platform dedicated to buying and selling musical instruments. On this platform, users can register and add new products for sale by providing detailed information and attaching images. The products are displayed on the homepage, which gathers all the ads from different users. Additionally, I have implemented a search feature on the homepage.

SoundDeal has an authentication system with various checks, including validation of correct email and password, and verification of duplicate registered emails.
